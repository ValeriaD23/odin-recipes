    <p>Traditional Indian dish made of spiced cauliflower and potatoes. This dish is steamed and then fried in oil making it intentionally dry and somewhat crispy. WARNING: This dish is extremely spicy, which is the way I like it. However, if you don't like your food that spicy, feel free to cut down on the serrano pepper and/or cayenne pepper. Also, I would recommend serving this with a side of raita or plain yogurt to cool the mouth down after eating.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>3 tablespoons vegetable oil, divided</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon cumin seed</li>
        <li>1 small onion, quartered and sliced</li>
        <li>2 serrano chile peppers, minced</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon ginger paste</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons ground coriander</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon paprika</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon turmeric powder</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon cayenne pepper</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon garam masala</li>
        <li>2 medium baking potatoes, peeled and cut into 1 inch pieces</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>½ head cauliflower, cut into florets</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons lemon juice</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat 2 tablespoons of oil over medium-high heat in a large pot. Fry cumin seeds for a few seconds until they turn golden brown and begin to pop. Reduce heat to medium, stir in the onion, and cook until lightly browned. Stir in serrano pepper and ginger; fry for 1 minute. Season with coriander, paprika, turmeric, cayenne, and garam masala; cook for 30 seconds until fragrant.</li>
        <li>Stir potatoes and salt into the pot, cover, and cook for 5 to 7 minutes. Add cauliflower, cover, and cook until cauliflower steams in its own juices until tender, about 20 minutes. Stir in lemon juice. Pour remaining 1 tablespoon of oil around the edges of the pot. Increase heat to medium-high and fry for 3 to 5 minutes to brown, stirring gently to avoid mashing the cauliflower.</li>
    </ol>
